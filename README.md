# 350finalexam
Final exam for the SE350 course at St. Cloud State University.

About this app: It was created using Javascript, HTML, React Native, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.
The main purpose of this app is to allow users to input and search for trails based on their
difficulty, location, season that they're open, and the name of the trail.

The requirements for the final exam/project were as follows:
  1. Add navigable screens, giving users the option to Add, Search, and Display items, Survey, and Graph pages.
  
  2. "Add" screen allows users to add an entry to a database.
  
  3. The "Search" screen allows users to query a database to see if a trail already has been added.
  
  4. On the "Display" screen, display the results from the "Search" screen using a FlatList.
  
  5. Implement Cube Effect on the navigable screens.
  
  6. On the Survey page(s), the first page asks whether or not the user enjoyed the application.
  Based on the answer, the next screen will say "Tell us why?" with specific things relative to 
  why the user may or may not have enjoyed the application.
  
  7. Once the user submits their survey answers, the final page displays a graph which keeps track of 
  survey results.
